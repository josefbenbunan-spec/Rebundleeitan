# Creative Principles

Read this file on every invocation. These are the guardrails that ensure quality without constraining creativity.

## The Prime Directive

Every visualization must feel **intentionally designed for its specific content**. If you swapped the content out, the design choices should feel wrong. The typography, color, layout, and interactions should all be in service of THIS content, THIS audience, THIS moment.

---

## Anti-Slop Rules

These are non-negotiable. Every visualization must satisfy ALL of these:

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Never use default fonts.** No Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui, or system fonts. Choose a distinctive Google Fonts pairing matched to the content's tone. Never use the same pairing twice in a row. | Default fonts are the #1 signal of generic AI output. |
| **Commit to a dominant color.** Not a balanced 5-color palette -- one dominant hue with supporting accents. Use CSS custom properties for consistency. | Even distribution of colors creates visual noise. Dominance creates identity. |
| **Dark mode is a redesign, not an inversion.** Adjust primary colors, reduce saturation, change surface colors. Don't just flip black and white. | Inverted designs look broken. Redesigned dark modes look intentional. |
| **Backgrounds have character.** Gradient meshes, subtle noise, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, textured surfaces. Never flat white or flat gray with no atmosphere. | Flat backgrounds make everything look like a wireframe. |
| **One orchestrated entrance animation.** Stagger content reveals on page load via `animation-delay`. Skip scattered micro-animations. CSS-only where possible. | A choreographed entrance feels designed. Random animations feel noisy. |
| **Every visualization looks different.** Vary fonts, colors, layout approaches, and interaction patterns across generations. If it looks like the last one you made, start over. | Repetition is the enemy of the skill's value proposition. |

## The Creative Brief

Before writing any HTML, you MUST complete this creative brief internally. Do not skip any question. Your design choices should flow from these answers.

### 1. PURPOSE
What is this visualization communicating? Who is the audience? What should they feel or understand after viewing it?

### 2. METAPHOR
What visual world does this content belong to? Don't name the archetype -- name a PLACE or OBJECT.

Not "this is a dashboard" but "this is a mission control room." Not "this is a presentation" but "this is a museum exhibit." Not "this is a report" but "this is a field journal from an expedition."

The metaphor guides every downstream decision: colors, typography, spacing, interactions.

### 3. TYPOGRAPHY
Name two specific Google Fonts. Articulate WHY they fit:

- **Display font** (headings, hero elements): What's the emotional register? Authoritative -> serif. Modern -> geometric sans. Technical -> monospace. Warm -> rounded humanist. Elegant -> high-contrast serif. Playful -> variable weight or rounded.
- **Body font** (paragraphs, labels): Must be readable at 16px. Should contrast with the display font in personality while harmonizing in proportion.

Browse https://fonts.google.com mentally. Consider fonts you haven't used recently.

### 4. PALETTE
Name ONE dominant hue and articulate why it matches the content's mood:
- Urgent/critical -> warm reds, deep oranges
- Calm/analytical -> cool blues, muted teals
- Growth/success -> greens, emeralds
- Creative/experimental -> purples, magentas
- Warm/approachable -> ambers, terracottas
- Technical/precise -> cool grays + one vivid accent

Then pick an accent that creates tension or complement with the dominant.

### 5. SIGNATURE
What ONE thing will make someone remember this visualization? Describe it in one sentence.

This could be: a striking background treatment, an unexpected layout decision, a clever hover interaction, an unusual typography choice, a distinctive color pairing, a memorable visual metaphor rendered in CSS.

### 6. COMPOSITION
- Dense or spacious? (Information-rich like a cockpit, or editorial like a magazine?)
- Scrolling or fixed? (Long-form narrative, or single-screen diagram?)
- Centered column or full-bleed? (Focused reading, or immersive experience?)
- Grid or organic? (Structured cards, or flowing asymmetric layout?)

## Typography Exploration

Font selection is the single highest-leverage creative decision. Here are starting points -- explore beyond these:

| Mood | Display Options | Body Options |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Editorial/Magazine | Playfair Display, Lora, Merriweather | Source Sans 3, Libre Franklin |
| Technical/Precise | JetBrains Mono, Space Mono, Fira Code | IBM Plex Sans, DM Sans |
| Bold/Modern | Sora, Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans | Work Sans, Nunito Sans |
| Warm/Humanist | Fraunces, Vollkorn, Bitter | Nunito, Open Sans |
| Geometric/Clean | Space Grotesk, Manrope, Urbanist | DM Sans, Karla |
| Elegant/Refined | Cormorant Garamond, Libre Baskerville | Lato, Raleway |
| Playful/Creative | Bricolage Grotesque, Rubik, Quicksand | Outfit, Red Hat Display |
| Data/Scientific | Fira Code, Source Code Pro | Fira Sans, Inter |

These are suggestions to spark exploration. The best choice is one that perfectly matches your metaphor.

## Color Exploration

Do NOT reuse the same palette. Explore these territories:

- **Warm earth**: Terracotta, sand, olive, warm brown, burnt sienna
- **Cool ocean**: Navy, teal, seafoam, pearl gray, deep blue
- **Monochromatic + pop**: All shades of one hue with a single contrasting accent
- **High contrast**: Near-black backgrounds with vivid accent (electric blue, hot pink, lime)
- **Muted/desaturated**: Soft pastels, dusty rose, sage, lavender
- **Bold/saturated**: Primary colors at full intensity, playful energy
- **Jewel tones**: Deep emerald, sapphire, amethyst, ruby
- **Industrial**: Concrete gray, steel blue, caution yellow, rust orange
- **Nordic**: Ice white, pale blue, soft gray, silver, pine green

---

## Motion Philosophy

- **Entrance**: Stagger content blocks with `animation-delay` (0.1s increments). Use `fadeInUp` (opacity + translateY) as the baseline, but consider alternatives: scale reveals, slide-ins from sides, blur-to-focus.
- **Hover**: One meaningful hover state per interactive element. Subtle lift (translateY + shadow) for cards. Color shifts for links. Scale for buttons.
- **Transitions**: 200-300ms for UI state changes. Ease-out for entrances, ease-in-out for state changes.
- **Restraint**: If you have more than 3 different animation types on a page, you have too many.

---

## Composition Principles

- **Generous negative space OR controlled density** -- never mushy middle ground. Decide which serves the content and commit.
- **Asymmetry creates energy.** Centered layouts are safe. Off-center hero text, overlapping elements, or breaking the grid creates visual interest.
- **Hierarchy through scale.** The most important element should be dramatically larger than everything else. If everything is the same size, nothing is important.
- **Maximum width matters.** Full-bleed for immersive (dashboards, graphs). 900-1100px max-width for reading (articles, proposals). 600-800px for diagrams.

---

## Footer

Every visualization ends with a two-line footer:

```
Rebundle · {date}
Generated with /viz
```

- **Line 1**: "Rebundle" and today's date.
- **Line 2**: `/viz` should link to `https://rebundle.ai`.
- Keep it small (0.7rem), centered, muted color, with a `border-top` separator.
- This is the ONLY templated element.
